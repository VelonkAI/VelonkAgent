# ðŸš€ Feature Request: [Short Descriptive Title]

 **Target Release**: vX.Y.Z | **Priority**: P0-P3  
**RFC Status**: [Draft | Under Review | Approved | Rejected]  
**Architecture Impact**: [Core | Module-Specific | External Integration]

## 1. Business Context & Value Proposition
### **Problem Statement**
<!-- What user pain point or technical limitation does this address? -->
> *Example: Agents in large swarms (>5k nodes) experience 300ms+ consensus latency during peak loads, violating SLA thresholds.*

### **Strategic Alignment**
- [ ] Core Framework Capability  
- [ ] Enterprise Customer Commitment (Customer: <!-- Name -->)  
- [ ] Open Source Community Demand  
- [ ] Technical Debt Resolution  
- [ ] Competitive Parity/Differentiation

### **Success Metrics**
| Metric | Current Baseline | Target Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Agent consensus latency | 320ms | â‰¤100ms |
| Cross-cluster sync throughput | 1.2M ops/sec | 3M ops/sec |
| API error rate (5xx) | 4.1% | <0.5% |

## 2. Technical Specifications
### **Architectural Blueprint**
```plaintext
Module: Consensus Engine
Components Affected:
- SwarmManager (core/orchestration)
